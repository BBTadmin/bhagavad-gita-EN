      	<h1>Setting the Scene</h1>
<p>Although widely published and read by itself, Bhagavad-gétä originally appears as an episode in the Mahäbhärata, the epic Sanskrit history of the ancient world. The Mahäbhärata tells of events leading up to the present Age of Kali. It was at the beginning of this age, some fifty centuries ago, that Lord Kåñëa spoke Bhagavad-gétä to His friend and devotee Arjuna.</p>
<p>Their discourse—one of the greatest philosophical and religious dialogues known to man—took place just before the onset of war, a great fratricidal conflict between the hundred sons of Dhåtaräñöra and on the opposing side their cousins the Päëòavas, or sons of Päëòu. </p>
<p>Dhåtaräñtra and Päëòu were brothers born in the Kuru dynasty, descending from King Bharata, a former ruler of the earth, from whom the name Mahäbhärata derives. Because Dhåtaräñöra, the elder brother, was born blind, the throne that otherwise would have been his was passed down to the younger brother, Päëòu.</p>
<p>When Päëòu died at an early age, his five children—Yudhiñöhira, Bhéma, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva—came under the care of Dhåtaräñöra, who in effect became, for the time being, the king. Thus the sons of Dhåtaräñöra and those of Päëòu grew up in the same royal household. Both were trained in the military arts by the expert Droëa and counseled by the revered “grandfather” of the clan, Bhéñma. Yet the sons of Dhåtaräñöra, especially the eldest, Duryodhana, hated and envied the Päëòavas. And the blind and weak-minded Dhåtaräñöra wanted his own sons, not those of Päëòu, to inherit the kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus Duryodhana, with Dhåtaräñöra’s consent, plotted to kill the young sons of Päëòu, and it was only by the careful protection of their uncle Vidura and their cousin Lord Kåñëa that the Päëòavas escaped the many attempts against their lives.</p>
<p>Now, Lord Kåñëa was not an ordinary man but the Supreme Godhead Himself, who had descended to earth and was playing the role of a prince in a contemporary dynasty. In this role He was also the nephew of Päëòu’s wife Kunté, or Påthä, the mother of the Päëòavas. So both as a relative and as the eternal upholder of religion, Kåñëa favored the righteous sons of Päëòu and protected them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, the clever Duryodhana challenged the Päëòavas to a gambling match. In the course of that fateful tournament, Duryodhana and his brothers took possession of Draupadé, the chaste and devoted wife of the Päëòavas, and insultingly tried to strip her naked before the entire assembly of princes and kings. Kåñëa’s divine intervention saved her, but the gambling, which was rigged, cheated the Päëòavas of their kingdom and forced them into thirteen years of exile.</p>
<p>Upon returning from exile, the Päëòavas rightfully requested their kingdom from Duryodhana, who bluntly refused to yield it. Dutybound as princes to serve in public administration, the five Päëòavas reduced their request to a mere five villages. But Duryodhana arrogantly replied that he wouldn’t spare them enough land into which to drive a pin.</p>
<p>Throughout all this, the Päëòavas had been consistently tolerant and forbearing. But now war seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as the princes of the world divided, some siding with the sons of Dhåtaräñöra, others with the Päëòavas, Kåñëa Himself took the role of messenger for the sons of Päëòu and went to the court of Dhåtaräñöra to plead for peace. When His pleas were refused, war was now certain.</p>
<p>The Päëòavas, men of the highest moral stature, recognized Kåñëa to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the impious sons of Dhåtaräñöra did not. Yet Kåñëa offered to enter the war according to the desire of the antagonists. As God, He would not personally fight; but whoever so desired might avail himself of Kåñëa’s army—and the other side could have Kåñëa Himself, as an advisor and helper. Duryodhana, the political genius, snatched at Kåñëa’s armed forces, while the Päëòavas were equally eager to have Kåñëa Himself.</p>
<p>In this way, Kåñëa became the charioteer of Arjuna, taking it upon Himself to drive the fabled bowman’s chariot. This brings us to the point at which Bhagavad-gétä begins, with the two armies arrayed, ready for combat, and Dhåtaräñöra anxiously inquiring of his secretary Saïjaya, “What did they do?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The scene is set, with only the need for a brief note regarding this translation and commentary.</p>
<p>The general pattern translators have followed in rendering Bhagavad-gétä into English has been to brush aside the person Kåñëa to make room for their own concepts and philosophies. The history of the Mahäbhärata is taken as quaint mythology, and Kåñëa becomes a poetic device for presenting the ideas of some anonymous genius, or at best He becomes a minor historical personage. But the person Kåñëa is both the goal and the substance of Bhagavad-gétä, so far as the Gétä speaks of itself.</p>
<p>This translation, then, and the commentary that accompanies it propose to direct the reader to Kåñëa rather than away from Him. The Bhagavad-gétä thus becomes wholly consistent and comprehensible. Since Kåñëa is the speaker of the Gétä, and its ultimate goal as well, the Bhagavad-gétä As It Is thus presents this great scripture in its true terms.</p>
